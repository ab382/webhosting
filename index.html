<br>
  <p><b>1.   Create a bucket in AWS S3 buckets.<br>
  2.  Check the lifecycle policies.<br>
  3.  Check ACL's private/public.<br>
  4.  What is encryption in S3.<br>
  5.  Check all "properties" and "permissions" options in S3.</b></p>

<center>
  <h3><b>To Do Regarding Each Topic</b></h3>
</center>
<br>
<center><h3><b>Simple storage service(S3)</b></h3></center><br>
<pre>         1. Amazon S3 is an object storage service that stores data as objects within buckets. An object is a file and any metadata that describes the file.
         2. A bucket is a container for objects. To store your data in Amazon S3, you first create a bucket and specify a bucket name and AWS Region.</pre><br>
<p><b>1. How to create a S3 bucket in aws?</b></p><br>
<P><i>To create a bucket in S3 follow the steps given bellow in gif image. While creating a bucket give the bucket name as unique name which does not choosen by someone around the world. Don't use capital letters and special charecters while creating a bucket use "-" with some random number to avoid polygramy.</i></P>

<p><b>1. What are lifecycle policy and how to use them?</b></p><br>
<P><i>Before moving to life cycle policies we need to learn about S3 tires.<br>
  <b><u>S3 tires:</u></b><br>
  Lets consider the S3 tires are classified into four types <b>General, Infrequent, Unkown, Archive.</b>
 Lets discuss more about these four topics.<br>
 <b><u>1. General:</u></b><br>
Coming to general type of tires the cost will be more because of multi availability zones. Lets consider the availability zone of bengalore is 4-5. We need to transfer the data and to retrive the data after some time, the data which you transfer is stored in one of those 4-5 data centers.Later on the data is circulated to all other data centers. This results when if one of the data center is down then, we can manage our data with other data centers.<br>
<img style="height: 400px; width: 700px;"src="https://dta0yqvfnusiq.cloudfront.net/facti15983775/2019/08/AWS-Regions-and-AZs-5d4475fa4ec9d.jpg"><br>
<b><u>Advantages:</u></b><br> 
1. Availability will be high.<br>
2. Performance will be high.<br>
<b><u>Disadvantages:</u></b><br>
Cost will be high compared to other tires about 0.22$/GB.<br><br>
 <b><u>2. Infrequent:</u></b><br>
Coming to infrequent type of tires the cost will be less compared to general type because of single availability zones. Lets consider the availability zone of bengalore is 4-5. We need to transfer the data and to retrive the data after some time, the data which you transfer is stored in one of those 4-5 data centers. This results when if the data center which the data are stored is down then, we cannot retrive the data which results the loss of all data.<br>
<b><u>Advantages:</u></b><br>
Cost will be low compared to General tires about 0.10$/GB.<br>
<b><u>Disadvantages:</u></b><br>
1.High risk.<br> 
2.Availability will be low compared to general standrads like 99.99%.<br><br>
 <b><u>3. Unknown:</u></b><br>
* Coming to unkown it is combination of both general and infrequent based on usage S3 decides weather to put in general or in infrequent.<br>
* So, it is minor monitoring cost.<br>
* Which means it's cost is the combination of general (or) infrequent like if S3 decides to put in general the cost will be 0.22$/GB or if S3 decides to put in infrequent the cost will be 0.10$/GB.<br><br>
 <b><u>4. Archive:</u></b><br>
Coming to archive it is classified into 2 types namely, <b>Glaciers and Deep Glaciers.</b><br>
* <b><u>Glaciers:</u></b><br>
1. In this glacier type it has archiving long live logs.<br>
2. Respose time is about 1 minute to 12 hours which means the data storing process exists about 1 minute to 12 hours but the retriving process takes upto 5 hours.<br>
3. The cost of glacier is about 0.004$/GB.<br>
* <b><u>Deep Glaciers:</u></b><br>
1. In this deep glacier type it has archiving more long live logs.<br>
2. Response time is about 10 years which means the data storing process exists about 10 years but the retriving process takes upto 12 hours.<br><br>
<b><u>Lifecycle policy</u></b><br>
* This lifecycle policy is to set rules for S3 bucket with these tires.<br>
* First 30 days we need general because at first we need huge data storage.<br>
* After 60 days moves to infrequent to save money.<br>
* After 90 days moves to glacier because our application work on months.<br>
* After 180 days moves to deep glacier because our application works on years.</i></P>
